# Poatek auto-test - create a todo list with class components.
## Candidate: Nataniel Porto
----------

I am so used to functional components that I've got rusty with the class oriented ones.

And, as I got so frustrated with the results of my test, because I KNEW I could do a to-do list, I decided to create another one from scratch, to prove my point.

*Cheers!*
